To find out how many passengers fit in 4 buses, we first need to determine the number of passengers that fit in one bus. We can do this by dividing the total number of passengers by the number of buses:

147 passengers / 7 buses = 21 passengers per bus

Now that we know each bus can hold 21 passengers, we can find out how many passengers fit in 4 buses by multiplying the number of passengers per bus by the number of buses:

21 passengers per bus * 4 buses = 84 passengers

Therefore, 84 passengers can fit in 4 buses.

generated_text:  To solve the problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Let's denote the original number of sweets in the pack by \( S \).
2. Each child takes 4 sweets, so the total number of sweets taken by 48 children is \( 48 \times 4 = 192 \).
3. After taking the sweets, there is still a third of the original amount left, so \( S - 192 = \frac{S}{3} \).
4. Solving the equation \( S - 192 = \frac{S}{3} \) will give us the original number of sweets \( S \).
5. The second pack has 20 fewer sweets than the original pack, so it has \( S - 20 \) sweets.
6. The total number of sweets consumed in a month is the sum of the sweets from both packs, which is \( 192 + (S - 20) \).
7. We will then calculate how many months they can consume this amount of sweets if they consume this total amount of sweets every week (4 weeks per month).

Let's solve the equation and calculate the number of months.
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define the variable
S = symbols('S')

# Define the equation
equation = Eq(S - 192, S / 3)

# Solve the equation
original_sweets = solve(equation, S)[0]

# Calculate the number of sweets from the second pack
second_pack_sweets = original_sweets - 20

# Total sweets consumed in a month
total_sweets_per_month = 192 + second_pack_sweets

# Calculate the number of weeks in a month
weeks_per_month = 4

# Calculate the number of months they can consume this amount of sweets
months_of_consumption = total_sweets_per_month / (original_sweets - 192) * weeks_per_month
print((original_sweets, total_sweets_per_month, months_of_consumption))
```
```output
(288, 456, 12)
```
The original number of sweets in the pack is \( 288 \). After taking 4 sweets each, there is still a third of the original amount left, which means \( 288 - 192 = \frac{288}{3} = 96 \) sweets are left. The second pack has \( 288 - 20 = 268 \) sweets. The total number of sweets consumed in a month is \( 192 + 268 = 460 \). Since they take 48 sweets per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, they consume \( 460 / (288 - 192) \times 4 = 460 / 96 \times 4 = 12 \) months of consumption.

Therefore, the number of months they can consume this amount of sweets is \(\boxed{12}\).

generated_text:  To determine how many hours it will take Beth to finish reading the remaining chapters, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Beth's reading rate:**
   Beth has read 3 chapters in 4 hours. Therefore, her reading rate is:
   \[
   \text{Reading rate} = \frac{3 \text{ chapters}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 0.75 \text{ chapters per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of chapters remaining:**
   The book has 10 chapters in total. Beth has already read 3 chapters, so the number of chapters remaining is:
   \[
   10 \text{ chapters} - 3 \text{ chapters} = 7 \text{ chapters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time required to read the remaining chapters:**
   Using her reading rate of 0.75 chapters per hour, the time required to read the remaining 7 chapters is:
   \[
   \text{Time required} = \frac{7 \text{ chapters}}{0.75 \text{ chapters per hour}} = \frac{7}{0.75} = \frac{7 \times 4}{3} = \frac{28}{3} \approx 9.33 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the number of hours it will take Beth to finish reading the remaining chapters is \(\boxed{\frac{28}{3}}\) or approximately 9.33 hours.

1. Calculate the number of fish that swim eastward that are caught by fishers.
2. Calculate the number of fish that swim westward that are caught by fishers.
3. Calculate the number of fish that swim north that are caught by fishers.
4. Subtract the number of caught fish from the total number of fish that swam in each direction.
5. Sum the remaining fish from all directions to get the total number of fish left in the sea.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. Fish swimming eastward:
   - Total fish swimming eastward: 3,200
   - Fish caught from the east: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3,200 = \frac{3,200}{3} = 1,066.67 \approx 1,067 \) (since the number of fish must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number)
   - Fish left swimming eastward: \( 3,200 - 1,067 = 2,133 \)

2. Fish swimming westward:
   - Total fish swimming westward: 1,800
   - Fish caught from the west: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1,800 = \frac{2 \times 1,800}{3} = 1,200 \)
   - Fish left swimming westward: \( 1,800 - 1,200 = 600 \)

3. Fish swimming northward:
   - Total fish swimming northward: 500
   - Fish caught from the north: \( 10\% \times 500 = \frac{10}{100} \times 500 = 50 \)
   - Fish left swimming northward: \( 500 - 50 = 450 \)

4. Sum the remaining fish from all directions:
   - Fish left swimming eastward: 2,133
   - Fish left swimming westward: 600
   - Fish left swimming northward: 450
   - Total fish left in the sea: \( 2,133 + 600 + 450 = 3,183 \)

Therefore, the number of fish left in the sea is \(\boxed{3183}\).

generated_text:  To find out how many books the bookseller sold in March, we can use the information given and set up an equation. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in March.
2. The total number of books sold in January, February, March, April, and May is \( 15 + 16 + x + 10 + 8 \).
3. The average number of books sold per month over the five months is 16. Since the average is the total number of books sold divided by the number of months, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{15 + 16 + x + 10 + 8}{5} = 16
   \]
4. To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   15 + 16 + x + 10 + 8 = 16 \times 5
   \]
5. Simplify both sides:
   \[
   49 + x = 80
   \]
6. Subtract 49 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x = 80 - 49
   \]
   \[
   x = 31
   \]

So, the bookseller sold 31 books in March. Let's verify this by coding the solution in Python.
```python
# Given values
books_jan = 15
books_feb = 16
books_apr = 10
books_may = 8
average_books = 16

# Total number of months
months = 5

# Total books sold in January, February, April, and May
total_books_others = books_jan + books_feb + books_apr + books_may

# Calculate the number of books sold in March
books_mar = (average_books * months) - total_books_others
print(books_mar)
```
```output
31
```
The bookseller sold \(\boxed{31}\) books in March.

1. First, determine the total amount of popcorn needed.
2. Calculate the total number of cups of popcorn required.
3. Calculate the total amount of oil needed, given that each cup of popcorn requires 0.5 ounces of oil.

We can use the following steps in Python to get the final answer:

1. Calculate the total cups of popcorn needed:
   - Joanie wants 3 cups
   - Mitchell wants 4 cups
   - Miles and Davis split 6 cups, so that's 6 cups total
   - Cliff wants 3 cups
   - Total cups of popcorn needed = 3 + 4 + 6 + 3 = 16 cups

2. Calculate the total amount of oil needed:
   - Each cup of popcorn requires 0.5 ounces of oil
   - Total oil needed = 16 cups * 0.5 ounces/cup = 8 ounces

Here is the Python code to calculate this:

```python
# Define the amount of popcorn needed for each person
popcorn_needed_joanie = 3  # cups
popcorn_needed_mitchell = 4  # cups
popcorn_needed_miles_davis = 6  # cups (since they split 6 cups)
popcorn_needed_cliff = 3  # cups

# Calculate the total cups of popcorn needed
total_cups_popcorn = popcorn_needed_joanie + popcorn_needed_mitchell + popcorn_needed_miles_davis + popcorn_needed_cliff

# Define the amount of oil needed per cup of popcorn
oil_per_cup = 0.5  # ounces

# Calculate the total amount of oil needed
total_oil_needed = total_cups_popcorn * oil_per_cup

# Print the result
print(total_oil_needed)
```
```output
8.0
```
The total amount of oil needed for the popcorn for movie night is \(\boxed{8}\) ounces.

1. Calculate the current annual production.
2. Determine the additional annual production needed.
3. Calculate the additional monthly production needed.

Let's break this down:

1. The current monthly production is 80 cars. Therefore, the current annual production is \(80 \times 12\).
2. The target annual production is 2160 cars.
3. The additional annual production needed is \(2160 - \text{current annual production}\).
4. The additional monthly production needed is the additional annual production divided by 12.

Let's calculate this using Python:
```python
# Given values
current_monthly_production = 80
target_annual_production = 2160

# Calculate current annual production
current_annual_production = current_monthly_production * 12

# Calculate additional annual production needed
additional_annual_production_needed = target_annual_production - current_annual_production

# Calculate additional monthly production needed
additional_monthly_production_needed = additional_annual_production_needed / 12

print(additional_monthly_production_needed)
```
```output
120.0
```
The car manufacturing company needs to add \(\boxed{120}\) cars to its monthly production rate to reach the target of 2160 cars per year.
