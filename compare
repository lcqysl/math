{"question": "48 children are trying to share a pack of sweets. After taking 4 sweets each, there is still a third of the original amount left. What is the original number of sweets in the pack?", "answer": "How many sweets did the children take? ** 48 children took 4 each for a total of 48*4 = <<48*4=192>>192 sweets\nHow many sweets are left? ** If there is 1/3 left then 192 is 1-(1/3) = 2/3 of the original amount (The whole packet minus 1 third)\nHow many sweets are there originally? ** Therefore 192 is 2/3 of the original amount: (2/3)* original amount = 192\nHow many sweets are there originally? ** Multiplying both sides of the equation by (3/2) gives: original amount = 192*(3/2) = <<192*3/2=288>>288\n#### 288"}
