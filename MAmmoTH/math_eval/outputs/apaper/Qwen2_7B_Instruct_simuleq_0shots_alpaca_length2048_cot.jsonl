This means if the distance from your house to your mother's house is \\(x\\) miles, then the distance from your current location to your house is \\(2x\\) miles.\n\n3. **Calculate the total distance traveled**: Since you are on your way to your mother's house, the total distance you have traveled is the sum of the distance from your current location to your mother's house and the distance from your mother's house to your house.

The correct interpretation is that the distance from your current location to your house plus the distance from your house to your mother's house equals the total distance to your mother's house. So, the distance from your current location to your house plus 234 miles (the distance to your mother's house) should equal the total distance to your mother's house.\n\n5. **Correct interpretation and calculation**: Since you are twice as far from your house as you are from your mother's house, the distance from your current location to your house is half of the distance to your mother's house. Therefore, the distance from your current location to your house is \\(234 / 3\\) miles (because the total distance is divided into three parts: two parts to your house and one part to your mother's house).

However, we first need to find Riza's current age.\n\n3. **Find Riza's current age:** Since the sum of their ages is 105, and we know the age difference is 25 years, we can set up the equation: Riza's age + (Riza's age - 25) = 105. Simplifying this, we get 2 * Riza's age - 25 = 105. Adding 25 to both sides gives us 2 * Riza's age = 130. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that Riza's current age is 65 years.\n\n4. **Calculate the son's current age:** Now that we know Riza is 65 years old, we can find her son's age by subtracting 25 from Riza's age (since the age difference is 25 years).

What is the average air speed of the plane in miles per hour and the average wind speed?  Let's think step by step.", "correct": ["450"], "solution": " \nTo solve this problem, we need to find the average airspeed of the plane and the average wind speed. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the average airspeed of the plane.\n\nFirst, we need to find the average airspeed of the plane when it's flying from Atlanta to Paris (East) and from Paris to Atlanta (West).\n\n- **Eastbound (Atlanta to Paris):** The flight takes 8 hours and covers 4000 miles.\n- **Westbound (Paris to Atlanta):** The flight takes 10 hours and covers 4000 miles.\n\nThe average airspeed of the plane can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Average Airspeed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\]\n\nFor both directions, the total distance is the same (4000 miles), so we can calculate the average airspeed for one direction and it will be the same for the other.\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Airspeed} = \\frac{4000 \\text{ miles}}{8 \\text{ hours}} = 500 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the average wind speed.\n\nTo find the average wind speed, we need to consider the difference in flight times for the two directions. The plane takes 2 hours longer to fly West than East, which means the wind is affecting the plane's speed more when flying against it (Westbound).\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(V_p\\) as the plane's airspeed in still air (which we've found to be 500 mph),\n- \\(V_w\\) as the average wind speed.\n\nWhen flying East (with the wind), the effective speed of the plane is \\(V_p + V_w\\), and when flying West (against the wind), the effective speed is \\(V_p - V_w\\).\n\nGiven that the plane takes 8 hours to fly East and 10 hours to fly West, we can set up the following equations based on the distances covered:\n\n\\[ (V_p + V_w) \\times 8 = 4000 \\]\n\\[ (V_p - V_w) \\times 10 = 4000 \\]\n\nWe already know \\(V_p = 500\\) mph, so we can substitute that value into the equations:\n\n\\[ (500 + V_w) \\times 8 = 4000 \\]\n\\[ (500 - V_w) \\times 10 = 4000 \\]\n\nSolving the first equation for \\(V_w\\):\n\n\\[ 4000 + 8V_w = 4000 \\]\n\\[ 8V_w = 0 \\]\n\\[ V_w = 0 \\]\n\nThis result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as we know there is a wind affecting the plane's speed.
