How many poets are there?', 'CLARIFIED QUESTION: At a writing workshop, the number of novelists is to the number of poets as 5 is to 3. The total number of participants at the workshop is 24. How many individuals at the workshop are novelists, and how many are poets?', "Let's think step by step. The ratio of novelists to poets is 5:3. This means for every 5 novelists, there are 3 poets. To find out how many individuals there are in each group, we first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 (novelists) + 3 (poets) = 8 parts.\n\nNow, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of participants (24) by the total number of parts (8): 24 / 8 = 3 participants per part.\n\nTo find the number of novelists, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts for novelists: 3 (novelists per part) * 5 (parts for novelists) = 15 novelists.\n\nTo find the number of poets, we do the same for poets: 3 (poets per part) * 3 (parts for poets) = 9 poets.\n\nThe answer is: 15 novelists and 9 poets."]], 'type': 'deepmind', 'answer': '15'}
